Project name: Battleship
Programmers: Rao Hamza Ali, Kevin Lisbin
Code Reviewer: Marc Karam

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 5 based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for the submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

once game is over, message says "you won" or lost "press enter to leave".  press enter and nothing happens.  press it again and a new game starts.  minor thing but should be addressed.
otherwise very nice
