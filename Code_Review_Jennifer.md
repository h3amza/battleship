Project name: Battleship
Programmers: Rao Hamza Ali, Kevin Lisbin
Code Reviewer: Jennifer Ly

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of *4* based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for the submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:
You can play the game, and it does everything you need it to if you play by the rules. However, I managed to get an "ArrayOutOfBoundsException" when I placed my ship at coordinates (3,4) horizontally.

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
Have a way to prevent an out of bounds exception on your board (because my ship also didn't show up when I decided to place it at (4,4)).
Also, when you win/lose, you should have an option of quitting or starting a new game.
